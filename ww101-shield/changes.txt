Copper:
1a. Add a pin with a pullup to the PSoC and one of the Arduino pins. (for prox led).
1b. Add an LED to one of teh PSoC pins called PLED. (for prox led). Also need silk that says PLED on Arduino header.
2. Add a ground probe hole with a wire loop sticking out the top.
3. Make copper rings around the 4 OLED pins thicker.
4. Move MB0 away from the edge of the LCD screen.
5. Change power/ground to the POT so that clock-wise is higher voltage? (Is this due to the particular POT used?
6. Move CapSense resistors further apart
7. Increase ground fill spacing to 8mils
8. Move LCD resistors to the bottom of the board or away from LCD?

Front Silk:
1. Move label for D9 to the left so that it is lined up with the hole
2. Make sure labels are not obscured by vias

Back Silk:
1. P17 should say CapSense B2 instead of CapB2 to match others
2. Move text for P31 over to align with others
3. P02 and P04 should be LED0/LED1 instead of MBLED0/MBLED1
4. P01 is MB0, P00 is MB1 - currently swapped
5. Make sure labels are not obscured by vias
