Added additional instructions to class setup to specify that
downloaded files must be unzipped before executing and that the
config.eml file must be in the folder with the installer. These steps
trip up a lot of students during the install.

Minor fixes from feedback from KY class.
Affects chapters 1, 2, 4, 6b, 7a, 7b, and 7c.
